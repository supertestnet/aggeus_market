# Aggeus market
Bitcoin prediction markets with non-interactive contract trading

# What is this?

Aggeus is an open protocol for building permissionless prediction markets on bitcoin. Combining ideas from DLCs, lightning, and PSBT auctions, Aggeus lets anyone build market infrastructure similar to popular platforms like Fanduel or Polymarket. The methods outlined here use bitcoin as the only asset, do not require any other blockchains, authentication systems, or custodians (unless you count addresses encumbered by DLC-like constraints as semi-custodial), and they allow anyone to create markets and trade contracts in them pseudonymously.
